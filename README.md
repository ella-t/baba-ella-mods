# baba-ella-mods
This is the repository I use to work on my mods for Baba is You.

You're free to download these mods to use them in your own level packs, or to use them as a base for creating your own mods, or for whatever other purpose.  If you do distribute them, I would prefer if you credit me.

## Downloads
Currently, there are no releases.  When a feature is complete, I'll make a release for it on the repository's [releases page.](https://github.com/ella-t/baba-ella-mods/releases)

You can download the whole repository at any time by clicking Code->Download Zip near the top of this page.  Because the repository is in the format of a level pack, you can extract the whole zip to a new folder in Baba Is You/Data/Worlds to play it in-game.
